# YuGiOh-Portfolio

Web Application that allows you to create Yu-Gi-Oh card binders/portfolios by searching online for cards to add.
Primarily used for my own personal binder collection and keeping track of the cards I have, as well as to help me decide on the layout of my portfolios.


Features
- Create multiple binders for display
- 3D display visual of the binder and cards
- Drag and drop card adding/removal
- Page manipulation (add, remove, swap etc.)
- Inventory system for storing cards that you own (count, rarity, version, condition etc.)
- Save and load as many binders as you like
- Share binders online using a URL share code
- Online search system that has every card in existance (TCG)
- Advanced search system for complex queries

90% done, not sure how many more features I'll add other than bug fixing, polishing and general improvements etc.
